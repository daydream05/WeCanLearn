<p>If you struggle with procrastination, understanding difficult concepts or retaining that knowledge that you just learned <strong>take this course</strong>. I suggest going through this course first before diving into any of the resources here. It would speed up your learning curve and it would keep you motivated to reach your learning goals. Applying these strategies to your learning process would make college life a lot easier.</p>

<p><strong><em>Note</em></strong>: <em>Coursera would suggest you to buy the course to get a certification. However, you can simply take the course for free by choosing 'Audit'.</em></p>

<p>If you are reading this poorly written blog, we have probably met in Baruch College and you're a business student that I'm trying to convince to learn how to code. With that said, <em>Automate the Boring Stuff with Python</em> is perfect for you. This book teaches you the basics of Python by making you build programs that would automate your business workflow. Such as sending email, web scraping, working with Excel Files without using Excel, and a lot more. </p>

<p><strong><em>Note:</em></strong> <em>The contents of the website is free but you can also purchase the <a href="https://www.nostarch.com/automatestuff">book</a> or the Udemy <a href="https://www.udemy.com/automate/">course</a> if you are used to following tutorials by watching. I was lucky to enroll on the Udemy course for free when the author published a promotional code on Reddit(Higher ratings and more students enrolled increases the likelihood of people purchasing the course. Either way, it was really nice of him)</em></p>

<p>As much as I adore the person who made <em>Automate the Boring Stuff</em>, the guy who made this website is a Godsend. I was probably inspired by his motives on doing his tutorials. In one of his videos, he mentions that the way he masters the concepts of Python is by teaching it to other people. He's a self-learner like us. Anyway, this website has a wide-range of Python tutorials on different fields. There's <strong>algorithmic trading</strong> for Finance, <strong>data analysis</strong> and <strong>machine learning</strong> for people interested in becoming a Data Scientist, <strong>web development</strong> using Flask or Django Framework(I'm using this to create an attendance application), and a LOT more. So stop reading this and head to the website. If you're a beginner Python then go to the basics, but if not or you're confident enough, you can head straight to the more advanced tutorials. </p>

<ol>
<li><a href="https://www.freecodecamp.com/">Free Code Camp</a></li>


<p>By far the best <strong>FREE</strong> web development curriculum out there. Like most online programming tutorials, <strong>Free Code Camp</strong> holds your hand until you have a basic understanding of the concepts. (i.e. look at this code, type this code, here is the result). However, what separates this website from others is that once they get your feet wet, you're on your own. It goes beyond repetitive input/output on a console. It actually gives you real life projects to work on. If you get stuck(I did and some people did), Free Code Camp has a really helpful community to help you out. Once you are done with all the projects for the specific certification you can move on to the next. Free Code Camp consists of 4 certifications:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Front End Development</strong>: Html/CSS/Javascript </li>
<li>
<strong>Data Visualization</strong>: Sass/React/D3</li>
<li>
<strong>Back End Development</strong> MongoDB/Express/Node</li>
<li>
<strong>Full Stack Development</strong> </li>
</ul>

<p>If you are able to get the first three certifications then you qualify to take the Full Stack development certification which lets you <strong>build</strong> websites for <strong>non-profit</strong> organizations! Most people who has followed the curriculum religiously, however, end up not finishing the whole thing because they get hired right away. (Tons of challenging projects to show). I didn't finish it either because I got lazy. So don't be like me!</p>
