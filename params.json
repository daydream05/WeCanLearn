Also it will help you deal with **procrastination**! \r\nThis course helped me breeze through difficult college classes. \r\nThis course is on going right now but you can audit the class and finish it on your own time. (You can finish it in an hour or 2.)\r\n\r\n### Web Development\r\n\r\n1. [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.com/)\r\n\r\nBy far the best **FREE** web development curriculum out there. Like most online programming tutorials, **Free Code Camp** holds your hand until you have a basic understanding of the concepts. (i.e. look at this code, type this code). However, what separates this website from others is that once you get your feet wet you're on your own. It goes beyond repetitive console input/output. It actually gives you real life projects to work on. If you get stuck(you will, I did and most people did), Free Code Camp has a really helpful community to help you out. Once you are done with all the projects for the specific certification you can move on to the next. Free Code Camp consists of 4 certifications:\r\n\r\n* **Front End Development**: Html/CSS/Javascript \r\n* **Data Visualization**: Sass/React/D3\r\n* **Back End Development** MongoDB/Express/Node\r\n* **Full Stack Development** \r\n\r\nIf you are able to get the first three certifications then you qualify to take the Full Stack development certification which lets you **build** websites for **non-profit** organizations! Most people who has followed the curriculum religiously, however, end up not finishing the whole thing because they get hired right away. (Tons of challenging projects to show). I didn't finish it either because I got lazy. So don't be like me!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
